Murder Mystery is a single player game inspired by the board game, Clue. The user is playing against 3 other bots. The point of the game is to be the first to guess who did it, with what weapon, and in what room. The user must also try to earn the LEAST amount of points possible. The more points the user has, the more likely they are to lose the game.


[RULES]

(1) POINTS
The goal of this game is to earn the least amount of points possible. Every turn, a character will earn 1 point. When a character wants to move rooms, they have a choice between rolling the dice and picking their own room. When a character decides to roll the dice, 3 rooms will be randomly selected, each with a random number of points between 1-3. If a character wants to pick their own room, they can choose whichever room they want, with the cost of 5 points. A character can also stay in the same room for as many rounds as they want, however that will cost 3 points.

(2) MAKING A HYPOTHESIS
When a character is ready to make a hypothesis, they get to choose which other character they want to ask for evidence. If the character they asked has evidence that matches their description (either character name, weapon, or room), they will be shown that piece of evidence. This means that element is innocent because it has just been proven NOT GUILTY.

(3) MAKING A CONCLUSION
When you are ready to give your final answer, select the 'Make a Conlusion' option and enter your guesses (character name, weapon, and room). You only get to make a conclusion twice. When you guess wrong the first time, 15 points will be added to your score. If you guess wrong again, you lose the game.

(4) BEAT THE COMPUTER
When another character has LESS points than you, then they have a greater chance of beating you. You can check another character's score by selecting 'Get Player Stats'.
